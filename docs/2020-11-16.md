Discussed topics:

1. Owner vs non owner interfaces;
   * Locatable
   * Transferable
   * Listable
   * etc
2. Methods returning strings as meta data / hints to describe how to represent actions on certain methods - c.f. the *feed* action of a monster NFT or the *fly* method of a rocket NFT
3. Meta data pointers to external URLs for heavier resources attached to the NFT
4. How to represent indexes for map iteration
5. Explore use of traits (define_trait, use_trait, impl_trait) to signal adherence to common interfaces for common standards e.g. tradable methods like set-sale-data
